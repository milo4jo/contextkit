# AGENTS.md

This repo is for ideation and planning of ContextKit.

## Current Phase
📋 **Ideation** — Refining the concept, researching the market.

## What's Here
- `docs/VISION.md` — Where we're heading
- `docs/PROBLEM.md` — Pain points we're solving
- `docs/COMPETITORS.md` — What exists today
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Technical thinking
- `docs/IDEAS.md` — Scratchpad for ideas

## How to Help

If you're Milo or another agent working on this:

1. **Add research** — Find relevant articles, papers, discussions
2. **Refine docs** — Make the thinking sharper
3. **Challenge assumptions** — Poke holes in the logic
4. **Prototype** — Small experiments to validate ideas

## Rules

- Keep docs concise and scannable
- Mark assumptions vs. facts
- Date your additions
- Don't delete ideas, mark them as rejected with reason
