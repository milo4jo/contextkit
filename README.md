# ContextKit

> Smart context management for AI applications

⚠️ **Early Stage** — This project is in ideation phase.

## The Problem

LLMs have limited context windows. Developers building AI features face hard choices:
- Too much context → expensive, noisy, slow
- Too little context → hallucinations, poor answers
- Manual curation → doesn't scale

**There's no good tooling for this.**

## The Vision

A developer toolkit that makes context management effortless:
- **Select** the right context automatically
- **Structure** it for optimal LLM performance
- **Analyze** what works and what doesn't
- **Iterate** with versioning and A/B testing

## Target Users

- **B2D**: Developers building AI features into their products
- **B2B**: Companies deploying AI agents/copilots at scale
